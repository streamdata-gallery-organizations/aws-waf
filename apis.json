AWSWAF gives you control over which traffic to allow or block to your webapplications by defining customizable web security rules. You can use AWSWAF to create custom rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQLinjection or cross-site scripting, and rules that are designed for your specific application. New rules can be deployed within minutes, letting you respondquickly to changing traffic patterns. Also, AWS WAF includes a full-featuredAPI that you can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenanceof web security rules.With AWS WAF you pay only for what you use. AWS WAF pricing is based on how many rules you deploy and how many web requests your web application receives. There are no upfront commitments.You can deploy AWS WAF on either Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution or the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that fronts your web servers or origin servers running on EC2.",
